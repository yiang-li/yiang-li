- 👋 Hi, I’m Yiang Li, I am a master student in Computational Social Science at Social Science Division, University of Chicago.
- 👀 My research interests lie in the intersection of data science and sociology, with a focus on aging, health, and education. Other than research, I have had multiple experiences working as an intern data engineer in industries.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research projects in quantitative sociology and social statistics.
