- 👋 Hi, I’m Yiang Li, I am a master student in Computational Social Science at, University of Chicago.
- 👀 My research primarily focuses on four areas in quantitative sociology: Aging and Life Course, Social Demography, Social Determinants of Health, and Social Policy. My primary research motivation is to use data science and/or computational techniques to 1) improve the understanding of how social conditions affect health outcomes, 2) examine the early-life drivers behind late-life health inequalities, and 3) evaluate social policies attempting to address inequalities.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research projects in quantitative sociology and social statistics.
