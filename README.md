- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yiang Li, I am a PhD student in Sociology at, the University of Chicago.
- ðŸ‘€ My research broadly focuses on: Social Demography, Health, Family, Aging and the Life Course, and Statistical Methods. My primary research motivation is to use statistical and/or computational techniques to 1) improve the understanding of how social conditions affect health outcomes, 2) examine the early-life contextual drivers that shape and perpetuate late-life health inequalities, especially the potential synergistic effects and interactions between family and context and 3) uncover the underlying social mechanisms behind stratified aging trajectories, such as gendered body shape standards, network homophiles, and assortative mating, that contribute to the intricate tapestry of health and social stratification 4) utilizing comparative approach to study variegated social processes along the life course led to diverging population health trajectories.
